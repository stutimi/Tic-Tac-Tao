# Tic-Tac-Tao Game
I created a simple yet interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a user-friendly interface, where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. It dynamically tracks the game state, checks for winning combinations, and declares a winner or tie. The design is clean and responsive.
